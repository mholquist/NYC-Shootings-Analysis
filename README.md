# Historical Analysis of NYC Shootings
_See the project [here](https://mholquist.github.io/NYC-Shootings-Analysis/)_

## Data 
This data comes from New York Cityâ€™s Open Data platform and is a historical record of shooting incidents in New York City. The data ranges from 2006 to 2022 and contains information such as victim demographics, perpetrator demographics as well as the date, time, and exact location of the incident. 

## Objective
Gun violence is a rising issue in the United States; I was curious about gun violence trends specifically in urban areas, such as New York City. Since this is historical data, I was motivated to explore if and how trends have changed over time. Furthermore, the results from this analysis can help aid policymakers when crafting policies related to gun violence or crime more generally.
